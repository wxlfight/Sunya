**Last Updated:** 2025-04-04

Welcome to Sunya! We are committed to protecting your personal privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect the information you provide to us by connecting your Garmin Connect service.

Please read this policy carefully before using the Sunya application. By connecting your Garmin Connect account and using our services, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

When you choose to connect your Garmin Connect account to Sunya, we collect the following types of health and activity data through the Garmin Connect API, based on your authorization:

*   **Activity Data:** Such as type, time, distance, calories burned, average/max heart rate, cadence, location (if authorized), etc., for activities like running, cycling, swimming.
*   **Daily Health Metrics:** Such as daily steps, distance, calories burned, sleep stages (deep, light, REM, awake), resting heart rate, real-time heart rate (if authorized and available), stress levels, Body Battery, etc.
*   **User Profile Information:** May include some basic information you set up in Garmin Connect (e.g., nickname, used to address you in the app).

We **only collect** data necessary to implement the core features of the Sunya application and will strive to clearly inform you of the required data scope when requesting authorization.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect primarily for the following purposes:

*   **Provide Core Functionality:** To analyze your health and activity data, identify patterns and trends, and present data insights to you based on the concept of "Emptiness" (objective presentation, guiding observation).
*   **Personalize Experience:** (Potentially in the future) To provide more personalized feedback or suggestions based on your data and goals.
*   **Application Improvement:** Anonymized and aggregated data may be used to analyze application usage to improve features and user experience (we will clearly state this and provide options before implementation).
*   **Communicate With You:** To send you important service-related notifications (e.g., updates to this Privacy Policy).

## 3. Data Storage and Security

*   Your authorized Garmin data will be stored in secure cloud databases we use (e.g., Supabase PostgreSQL).
*   We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These include, but are not limited to, data transmission encryption (HTTPS), database access control, and encryption of sensitive credentials (like Garmin Tokens).
*   However, please understand that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We highly value your privacy. We commit that:

*   We will **not** sell, rent, or trade your personally identifiable information or identifiable raw health data to any third party.
*   We will **not** share your personal data with third parties without your explicit consent, unless required by law or regulation, to enforce our terms of service, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of ourselves, other users, or the public.
*   If future features require sharing data with third-party services (e.g., AI services for advanced analysis), we will notify you in advance, explain the purpose and scope of sharing, and obtain your consent.
*   We may use or share **anonymized, aggregated** data (i.e., data that cannot identify you specifically) for research, statistical analysis, or service improvement.

## 5. Your Rights

You have control over your data:

*   **Access and Review:** You can view the data we have collected from Garmin Connect and stored within the Sunya application.
*   **Disconnect:** You can disconnect the Sunya application from your Garmin account at any time, either within the Sunya app or through the Garmin Connect platform. Upon disconnection, we will stop collecting new data from you.
*   **Data Deletion:** You can request the deletion of your personal data stored by us. Please contact us using the details below. After verifying your identity, we will delete your data as required by applicable law (unless we have a legal obligation to retain it).

## 6. Third-Party Services
